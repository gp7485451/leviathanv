**I have been on a break from working on leviathan, I am now currently working on it
LAST UPDATE 7/9/2011**
**You may notice the repository is now empty. This is only because I am adding 64 bit code soon**

Leviathan is a new 64 bit operating system that intends to be used widely by the general public. This may seem a huge goal, but I believe it is necessary for a new operating system to be made to fully bring out the power of today's current hardware. One of the operating systems main(coolest) features, is that it allows for huge expansion for storage with the RWFS fileystem. The FS allows for more than **500 million exabytes** of storage on a single partition! If you wish to join the project, contact me at nekros729@gmail.com. Also, send comments and suggestions to nekros729@gmail.com as well.

**NOTE**  I'm working on the kernel right now and it will take a bit to get the RWFS  filesystem running and also having a working multiboot rwfs loader. Also the design specification is not complete, especially the device system.
