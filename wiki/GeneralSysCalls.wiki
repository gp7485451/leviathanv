#summary General explanation of system calls

= Introduction =
This section intends to explain how system calls are generally implemented in the kernel. There are three classes of system calls in the kernel:
  * Application
  * Module
  * Server
All calls are done through interrupts, with one class corresponding to a single interrupt. 

= Details =
Here are the interrupts that correspond to each class:
  * Application - 0x70
  * Module - 0x71
  * Server - 0x72
