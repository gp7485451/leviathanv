#summary Device Driver Interface

= Introduction =

Most microkernels take a heavy performance hit,because of the way they handle device I/O. All device drivers are separate processes that manage devices. Leviathan improves the performance of the system by only loading and running servers when requested by a process. After all processes release the device, it can be unloaded until the next request.
