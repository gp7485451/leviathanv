#summary Design Document

= Introduction =

I believe that for operating systems to *truly* improve in this period in time,
there needs to be a new operating system created, that is not bloated and can be expanded upon easily. 

=Kernel=

Leviathan achieves a lack of bloat through a Hybrid Kernel. This way, for speed purposes, some modules can be run in kernel land and if a feature is wanted it can be added in user land. This way the kernel is small and manageable, while being very extensible.


=Intended OS Features=

*Planned For Version 1.0.0*
----
  * RWFS File System - 500 million exabytes of possible storage!
  * Virtual File System - many filesystems can be read
  * Virtual Disk System - allows for multiple disks to be treated as one
  * Preemptive Multitasking
  * ELF Executables
