= Introduction =

I believe that for operating systems to *truly* improve in this period in time,
there needs to be a new operating system created, that is not bloated and can be expanded upon easily. Adding new *Features* inside the kernel just adds more bugs. The only thing the kernel really needs to do is manage how software interacts with the hardware, nothing else.

=Kernel=

Leviathan achieves a lack of bloat through a Hybrid/Micro Kernel. This way, for speed purposes, some modules can be run in kernel land and if a feature is wanted it can be added in user land. This way the kernel is small and manageable, while being very extensible.
